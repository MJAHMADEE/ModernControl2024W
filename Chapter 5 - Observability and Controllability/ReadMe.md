## 5.1 Observability
### 5.1.1 Introduction
Introduction to the concept of observability in control systems.

### 5.1.2 Definition of Observability
A detailed explanation of what it means for a system to be observable.

### 5.1.3 Tests for Observability
Different methods and tests to determine if a system is observable.

### 5.1.4 Unobservable Subspace
Discussion on the subspace of system states that are not observable.

### 5.1.5 Detectability
Exploration of detectability, which is closely related to observability but under weaker conditions.

## 5.2 Controllability
### 5.2.1 Definition of Controllability
Definition and explanation of controllability in control systems.

### 5.2.2 Controllable and Uncontrollable States
Examination of the states that can and cannot be controlled within a system.

### 5.2.3 Tests for Controllability
Overview of tests used to assess the controllability of a system.

### 5.2.4 Stabilizability
Discussion on stabilizability, an extension of controllability.

### 5.2.5 Controllable Subspace
Description of the subspace within which the system states can be fully controlled.

## 5.3 Kalman Decomposition of LTI Systems
An in-depth look at the Kalman decomposition for Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) systems, providing a clearer understanding of system dynamics.
